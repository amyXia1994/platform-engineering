### focus on functional logic

> When I build professional software, I want most of my time to be spent within the functional domain of my application, instead of non-functional mechanics of the platform I use.

### agility

The ideal way to develop is to make a small change, compile, deploy and verify the change quickly. Then revolve this process periodically. Develp on the cloud now is not fast enough to provide instant feedback.

> When I started programming, I used Borland C++. It used to take about 100ms to compile and run a program on an IBM PC AT machine (TURBO ON). An average iteration cycle in the cloud takes minutes. Minutes! Sometimes dozens of minutes!
